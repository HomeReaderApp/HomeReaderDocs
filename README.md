# User Stories

### Teacher User

The first user of this application is a ‘Teacher’ in a primary school setting. However, this app could also potentially be used in secondary schools or special education settings as well. The ‘Teacher’ user is a user that is responsible for a class of students that encourage home reading every day. 

-	As a teacher, I want to be able to register and login securely to ensure I protect the school home reading data of students.
-	As a teacher, I want to be able to create my own class and give it an identifiable name.
-	As a teacher, I want to be able to add students to my class with a first and last name and a school year level.
-	As a teacher, I want to be able to give all my students a unique login code that they can use to login to a page to record their home reading.
-	As a teacher, I want to be able to view a list of the students in my class.
-	As a teacher, I want to be able to delete a student from the class list if a student leaves the class or the school.
-	As a teacher, I want to be able to view a list of books each of my students has read.
-	As a teacher, I want to find out how many nights each of my students has read.
-	As a teacher, I want to view a list of books that have a high rating from the students.
-	As a teacher, I want to view a list of any comments the students have submitted from their reading.

### Parent/Student user

The second user of this planned HomeReader App is a parent or student. These users are considered here as the same type of as user as what they want to be able to achieve is exactly the same. In a Primary school, students in lower grades do not yet have the ability to effectively use technology and record the appropriate information, therefore parents would need to be the user in this case and input the information. However, older primary school students are quite capable of recording their own home reading without the assistance of a parent. Therefore, they would still be using the app the exact same way as any parent user and for the same purpose.

-	As a parent/student, I want to be able to login easily to the HomeReader form page.
-	As a parent/student, I want to be able to input the title of the book read by the student, a rating of the book and a comment about the student’s reading.
-	As a parent/student, I want to be able to submit the form and get confirmation that it has been sent to the teacher.

### Modifications to user stories:

#### Teacher 

After discussion with a variety of teachers, young and old, the following user stories were created. Most teachers indicated that they would be logging in and accessing the application from a computer or tablet. 

-	As a teacher, I want to be able to access the information quickly.
-	As a teacher, I want the page to be easy to navigate.
-	As a teacher, I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it.
-	As a teacher, I want to be able to edit/update my students details or login codes.

#### Parent/Student

After discussion with parents and students at my current school, the following user stories need to be considered. Most of the below are to do with design and layout aspects of the application. Also, most students/parents indicated that they would access app on a mobile or tablet device.

-	As a parent/student, I want a simple and easy to remember login code.
-	As a parent/student, I want the page to record reading details to be uncluttered and easy to read.
-	As a parent/student, I want a calm screen view as students often read just before bed and record their results then.
-	As a parent/student I want the application to be easily accessible and viewable on a mobile or tablet device as well as a computer screen.
